TODO:
- Write up instructions for MovieCard.test.js. It's very similar, so be less hand-hold-y and don't give the code
- Write tests for Sidebar: test updating genre and checking to see if updated (userEvent.change ?)
- Write integration test for MovieContainer - create a test array with 3 movies, check that 3 movie cards are rendered
  - Then check that clicking a card will cause the modal to appear
- Then write instructions for Sidebar & MovieContainer
- Make a new branch & revert back the studio to the basic form
